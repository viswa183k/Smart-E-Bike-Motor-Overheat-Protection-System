# Smart E-Bike Motor Overheat Protection System

This project protects an electric bike hub motor from thermal overload.  
An NTC thermistor continuously monitors temperature, and the Arduino automatically cuts motor PWM when the temperature crosses the safe threshold.  
It helps avoid coil burnout, increases motor lifespan, and enhances safety during long rides.

### Features
- Real-time motor temperature monitoring  
- Automatic PWM cut-off when overheating  
- Simple hardware with high reliability  
- Suitable for hub motor and BLDC setups  

### Hardware Required
- Arduino board  
- NTC Thermistor  
- Motor Driver (PWM compatible)  
- Hub motor (test bench or simulation)
